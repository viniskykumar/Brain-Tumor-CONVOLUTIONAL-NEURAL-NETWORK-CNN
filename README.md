# Brain-Tumor-CONVOLUTIONAL-NEURAL-NETWORK-CNN
This project demonstrates how to classify brain MRI scans into four categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The categories include:  Glioma Meningioma Pituitary No Tumor The CNN model is trained on a dataset of MRI images and aims to accurately classify the images based on the presence and type of tumor.
